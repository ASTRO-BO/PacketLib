PacketLib
=========
PacketLib is a C++ open-source software library for writing applications which deal with satellite telemetry source packets, provided that the packets are compliant with the CCSDS Telemetry and Telecom- mand Standards. The library is being used within the Italian Space Agency (ASI) mission AGILE for simulation, graphical display, process- ing and decoding of the telemetry generated by the Test Equipment (TE) of two AGILE detectors. From an input stream of bytes, the library is able to recognize automatically the source packets (described by a sim- ple configuration file), and provides a simple access to each packet field by means of an object oriented interface. In the same way the library writes source packets to output stream. Various types of input and out- put streams are abstracted by a software layer.
