PacketLib
=========
PacketLib is a C++ open-source software library for writing applications which deal with satellite telemetry source packets, provided that the packets are compliant with the CCSDS Telemetry and Telecommand Standards. The library is being used within the Italian Space Agency (ASI) mission AGILE for simulation, graphical display, processing and decoding of the telemetry generated by the Test Equipment (TE) of two AGILE detectors, for the CNES/COROT satellite, for Euclid and ASTRI projects for the development of test equipments and AIV softwares. From an input stream of bytes, the library is able to recognize automatically the source packets (described by an XML configuration file), and provides simple access to each packet field by means of an object-oriented interface. In the same way the library writes source packets to output stream. Various types of input and output streams are abstracted by a software layer.
